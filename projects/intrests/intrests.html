        <h2> Why I like it...</h2>
        <p><span class="important">Irish music</span> is an auditory tradition, which means that songs were learned by ear. It is all about taking a song and making it your own. Everyone has their own interpretaition and even the most well known songs have many variations.</p> 
        <h2>Instruments</h2>
        <p>There are a lot of instruments used in celtic music. I play the violin (or fiddle), pennywhistle, and flute. Someday I would like to learn the bodhran (irish drum), bagpipe, and harp.</p>
        <h2>Favorite Bands</h2>
        <p>Some of my favorite bands/music artitsts include Brian Finnegan, Altan, Keela, The Koors, Faun, and Celtic Woman. Click <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/20fwGjw7IpBUMzxjb3gvET">here</a> to go to Brian Finnegan's spotify profile. He is a very talented irish flute and penny whistle player!</p>
