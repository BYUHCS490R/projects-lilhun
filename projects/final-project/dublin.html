            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Dublin is the largest city in Ireland and also its capital. Originally a Viking settlement, it has remained a central city since medieval times (IrishTourism.com). Today, Dublin is full of historical layers as modern architecture sits alongside medieval castles, old cathedrals, and elegant Georgian townhouses. There are many historical sites to visit, including Dublin Castle; Trinity College, one of the oldest universities in Ireland; and Christ Church Cathedral, built in 1030 and one of the city’s oldest surviving buildings.</p>

            <h2>Activities</h2>
            <p>If you like a bit of fresh air, you can also visit Dublin’s sprawling gardens and vast public parks. Phoenix Park, the largest park in Dublin, covers 1,750 acres (Wikipedia). The city also has a rich music, art, and food culture scene. The Cobblestone is a well-known pub for traditional Irish music sessions, while the city’s restaurants, shops, and libraries make it a great place to explore.

            <h2>Countryside</h2>
            <p>Dublin is also a great place to begin your travels, thanks to Dublin International Airport. Don’t spend all your time inside the city; just outside it lie beautiful countryside, coastal hills, and seaside towns with stunning views, such as Dalkey, Killiney, Portrane, and Howth. County Dublin offers far more than its city center alone (Fodor’s Travel).
