            <h2>History...</h2>
            <p>Located in County Kilkenny, Kilkenny City began as a small Christian settlement in the 6th century, built along the banks of the River Nore. After the Norman invasion in 1172, Kilkenny Castle was constructed, and walls were built around the town to protect it from further attacks. It later grew into a prominent Norman merchant town and wasn’t officially declared a city until 1662. (Wikipedia)

            <h2>City...</h2>
            <p>With an impressive array of large stone buildings—castles, cathedrals, and abbeys—this medieval city continues to awe visitors who walk its cobbled streets.  Be sure to explore historical landmarks such as the 12th-century Kilkenny Castle, the Medieval Mile Museum, and Black Abbey. Kilkenny also has a thriving arts and crafts scene, with numerous galleries, shops, and museums to enjoy. (Ireland.com)

            <h2>Activities</h2>
            <p>Just outside the city, the River Nore winds through a series of small towns and villages, each shaped by centuries of local tradition and history. County Kilkenny sits in the heart of Ireland’s “Ancient East,” so you’re never far from a striking castle, historic manor, medieval settlement, or old abbey. The surrounding countryside also offers plenty of ways to enjoy the outdoors, from walking and cycling to kayaking and paddleboarding. (Ireland.com)
