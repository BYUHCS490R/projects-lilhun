        <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Journey through Irenland</h2>
        <p>1. My website will be a traveler's guide to Ireland. It will include information on iconic sites and places to visit. It will also feature a table with a complete itinerary to help users plan their trip. </p>
        <p>2. Ireland has always fascinated me. I love listening to and playing Irish music, and I enjoy watching movies based on Irish folklore. Even though I have never been to Ireland, this project will be a fun way to learn more about it and begin planning a future trip!</p>
        <h2>My Pages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Homepage:</strong> Overview of Ireland, introduction, and site navigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Page 1: Dublin</strong> – About the city, activities, and travel tips.</li>
            <li><strong>Page 2: Kilkenny</strong> – Overview, history of the city, and specific sites to visit (including Kilkenny Castle).</li>
            <li><strong>Page 3: Iconic Sites</strong> – Newgrange, Cliffs of Moher, and Giant’s Causeway with overviews, facts, tips, and places to stay nearby.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>4. My website will include a request a travel itenerary form. It will collect the users name, email, interests, places they want to visit, length of trip, and trip budget. When the form is submitted the user will see a popup that informs them that a custom travel plan is being made and will be sent to their email shortly.</p>
        <p>5. I will get the information from my site by using reliable sources such as official tourisum websites, travel guides, and educational sources. I will use images with copyright free usage form sites such as pixels or any pulbic domain serach.</p>
