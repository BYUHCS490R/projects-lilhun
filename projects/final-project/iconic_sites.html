                Visit Newgrange, a Neolithic stone monument built over 5,200 years ago by Stone Age farmers in the Boyne Valley, County Meath. Newgrange is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most remarkable prehistoric structures in Europe.
                The monument consists of a large circular mound, 13 meters (43 ft) high, covering about 1 acre, with a 62-ft long narrow passage leading to a central chamber. The outside is lined with 97 kerbstones, many decorated with megalithic art. During the winter solstice, a specially aligned opening allows sunlight to illuminate the passage and chamber—an engineering achievement that remains astonishing today. While the exact purpose of Newgrange is still unknown, it’s believed to have served as a passage tomb or ceremonial site with spiritual or religious importance. (Newgrange.com)

                <h2>Site 2: Killarney National Park </h2>
                <p>Stretching across about 24,710 acres, Killarney National Park is the perfect place to visit if you want breathtaking natural views. A vast expanse filled with Ireland’s tallest mountains, lakes, forests, and waterfalls is sure not to disappoint! It was designated as Ireland’s first national park in 1932, but it has been inhabited by people since the Bronze Age, so there's plenty of chance to stumble across some stone ruins! The best way to get around the park is by bike, so buckle your helmets!(theirishroadtrip.com)</p>

            <h2>Site 3: Giants Causeway</h2>
            <p>Located on Northern Ireland’s coastline, Giant’s Causeway is truly a sight to behold! Giant hexagonal columns tumbling into the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by steep sea cliffs, is not something you see every day! According to legend, the causeway was formed by a giant who tried to lay a path of stepping stones to Scotland. This is a popular place to visit, so make sure you book your tickets and tours in advance (Ireland.com).
